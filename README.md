# General information
My first application developed at university featuring implication of some common sorting algorithms with Python3. I used only PyQt5 module since I realized all of the sorting methods from scratch and it did not require external libraries.<br /> <br />

To launch application excecute "Sorting.py" or "Sorting.exe" file.
